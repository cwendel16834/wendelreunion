			<h2>Where to meet at the Picnic</h2>
			<p>We can meet at the covered front porch of the church at 1:00 PM to visit.  There are a few benches, or you can bring a lawn chair for extra seating.</p>
			<p>We will try to set up a table at the church around 11 am so you can stop by and register, to let other family members know which Wendel relatives have arrived.  Please email Nancy if you’re thinking of coming, in case we have updates to these plans.</p>
			<p>Come early and enjoy the all-day annual church picnic, always the 1st Sunday in October. Mass begins at 10:30 am. You can buy BBQ plates and other refreshments to support the church community, with dining in the NEW HALL or the outdoor pavillion. There will be entertainment for all ages--bring your kids!</p>
