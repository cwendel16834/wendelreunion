			<h2>Where to meet at the Picnic</h2>
			<p>We can meet at the covered front porch of the church at 1:00 PM to visit informally with our Wendel relatives.  These would be the descendants of Peter Jacob and Barbara (Braden) Wendel.  </p>
			<p>We will try to have a Wendel Family registration booklet at the church entrance, so you can sign in when you arrive to let others know which relatives are at the picnic.</p>
			<p>Come early and enjoy the all-day annual church picnic. Mass begins at 10:30 am. You can buy BBQ plates (11 am – 2 pm) and other refreshments to support the church community, with dining in the NEW HALL or the outdoor Pavillion. There will be entertainment for all ages--bring your kids!</p>
			<p>P.S. The traditional Wendel Reunion will be Saturday October 11, 2014 in Wharton, Texas. <br /><a href="Wendel_Reunion.pdf">See Invitation<a /> </p>
