        <h2>Where to meet at the Picnic</h2>
        <p>We are meeting in the yard between the Church and the Rectory at 1:00 PM. You can bring a lawn chair if you like, for visiting with your cousins.</p>
		<p>We plan to set up a registration table around 11 am so
		everyone can know which other Wendel relatives have
		arrived at the picnic.</p>
		<p>Come early and enjoy the all-day annual church
		picnic, always the 1st Sunday in October. Mass begins
		at 10:30 am. You can buy BBQ plates and other
		refreshments to support the church community. There
		will be entertainment for all ages--bring your kids!</p>
